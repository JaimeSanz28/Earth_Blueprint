## Description

This is a **MongoDB - Geospatial Queries** project for *Ironhack*. 
The purpose of the project is to find the optimal location for a tech startup looking to grow fast. I have used a json file from *MongoDB* to sort a list of... I have also extracted data from *Foursquare's*  PLaces API to locate the coordinates that tick the most boxes in terms of the company's preferences.

## Company Scheme

A recently created company in the **GAMING industry** needs to find the best location in which to build its offices. The company will have the following scheme:
​
- 20 Designers
- 5 UI/UX Engineers
- 10 Frontend Developers
- 15 Data Engineers
- 5 Backend Developers
- 20 Account Managers
- 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
- 10 Executives
- 1 CEO/President

## Preferences by priority

​`VIP` - Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.

`HIGHLY IMPORTANT` - Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.

`HIGHLY IMPORTANT` - Account managers need to travel a lot

`IMPORTANT` - The CEO is Vegan

`IMPORTANT` - 30% of the company have at least 1 child.

`LITTLE IMPORTANCE` All people in the company have between 25 and 40 years, give them some place to go to party.

`LITTLE IMPORTANCE` - The office dog "Pepe" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.
